libtrace4 (4.0.22-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix segmentation fault when closing an ndag input that had
    set a hasher function and was configured to use multiple
    processing threads.
  * Disable setting a hasher function on ndag inputs, as this
    is not generally a good idea anyway (ndag inputs are already
    hashed by the ndag sender).
  * Fix problem where trace_write_packet() would throw an error on
    ring outputs because a write could not be completed without
    blocking and there was no mechanism for trying the write again
    later.

  * Added option to tracereplay to control transmit packet batch size.
  * Fixed bug in traceends that was produced invalid byte counter values.
