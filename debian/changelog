libtrace4 (4.0.15-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix bug where reading pcapng trace files would produce endless
    "NULL meta passed into trace_get_payload_from_meta()" errors.
  * Fix bug in libpacketdump which would cause packets captured
    using SLL to be truncated by 16 bytes.

libtrace4 (4.0.14-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Add read and write support for AF_XDP (xdp:). Users may run the provided
    eBPF program or write their own custom one.
  * Add basic API for parsing RADIUS messages: trace_get_radius(),
      trace_get_radius_avp(), trace_get_radius_username().
  * tracediff can now write differing packets to libtrace outputs, rather
    than just dumping them to the terminal.
  * Updated tracediff to be able to "look ahead" to see if packets can be
    matched rather than just directly comparing packets in the same position.
  * Added option to tracereplay to control transmit packet batch size.
  * Fixed bug in traceends that was produced invalid byte counter values.

libtrace4 (4.0.12-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Added new tool: tracemcast.
  * Added support for corsaro-tagged packets received via nDAG multicast.
  * Improved performance of multiple calls to trace_get_wire_length() on
    the same packet.
  * Fix truncation bug when a packet has a longer capture length than
    wire length due to the addition of post-capture meta-data.

libtrace4 (4.0.11-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Fix bug where trace_apply_filter() would not work correctly with a
    parallel trace input.
  * Fix bug where non-parallel ETSI programs would fail to halt nicely.
  * Fix libpacketdump being unable to decode Ethernet within MPLS properly.
  * Fix libtrace (trace_get_layer3()) being unable to decode Ethernet
    within MPLS properly.
  * tracereplay now strips VLAN and MPLS headers before trying to replay a
    packet from a trace file.
  * Fix bug where the simple circular buffer would leak shared memory files.
  * Fix segfault when using trace_apply_filter() on a packet which came from
    an input trace that is now "closed".
  * Fix bug where libtrace could try to flush a NULL pcap file handle.
  * debian-specific: fix missing dependency on libpacketdump4 for
    libtrace4-tools.
