----------------------------------

Installing libtrace:

./bootstrap.sh (only if you've cloned the source from GitHub)
./configure
make
make install

The above series of commands will install libtrace into /usr/local/lib. If
you wish to install to a non-standard location, append the
--prefix=DIR option to the ./configure command. ./configure also takes
a number of other options - run ./configure --help to view a comprehensive
list.

You may need to add the library location (e.g. /usr/local/lib) to your
/etc/ld.so.conf and run 'ldconfig' as root.

Installation FAQ:

Q. I've installed libpcap but I'm still getting the following error:
"libpcap0.8 or greater is required to compile libtrace. If you have installed
it in a non-standard location please use LDFLAGS to specify the location of
the library"?

A. You need to install the development version of the pcap library.
For example, Ubuntu/Debian users will need to install the libpcap0.8-dev
package in addition to the libpcap0.8 package.


Q. What operating systems do you support?

A. Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and OpenBSD. Windows is not supported.
