.TH TRACEANON "1" "May 2019" "traceanon (libtrace)" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
traceanon \- anonymise ip addresses and other sensitive information in traces
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B traceanon 
[ \-C configfile | \-\^\-config=configfile ] sourceuri desturi

.SH DESCRIPTION
traceanon anonymises a trace by replacing IP addresses found in the IP header,
and any embedded packets inside an ICMP packet.  It also replaces the checksums
inside TCP, UDP and ICMPv6 headers with zeroes.

Two anonymisation schemes are supported. The first replaces a prefix with
another prefix.  This can be used to replace a /16 with an equivalent prefix
from RFC1918, for instance.  The other scheme is cryptopan which is a
prefix preserving encryption scheme based on AES (traceanon must be built
with libcrypto support to be able to use the cryptopan scheme).

traceanon can also anonymise sensitive fields within RADIUS packets, such as
usernames, password hashes and IP addresses.

.SH CONFIGURATION
As of libtrace 4.0.8, traceanon can (and should) now be configured using a
YAML-formatted file instead of via a series of command-line arguments. Use the
\-C command line switch to tell traceanon the location of your configuration
file.

Configuration options in YAML can be expressed at one of three levels: the
top level (i.e. no indentation), ipanon (i.e. within an 'ipanon' map) or
radius (i.e. within a 'radius' map). See EXAMPLES below for an example
configuration file with entries at each level.

Options supported by traceanon are:

.TP
.PD 0
.BR "compress_level " (top-level)
sets the compression level for the anonymised output trace file.

.TP
.PD 0
.BR "compress_type " (top-level)
sets the compression method for the anonymised output trace file (gzip, bzip2,
etc.).

.TP
.PD 0
.BR "threads " (top-level)
sets the number of processing threads used to read from the input source.

.TP
.PD 0
.BR "filterstring " (top-level)
ignores all packets that do NOT match the given BPF filter.

.TP
.PD 0
.BR "encode_addresses " (ipanon)
specifies which addresses should be anonymised within the IP header -- can
be one of 'both', 'none', 'source' or 'dest'.

.TP
.PD 0
.BR "prefix_replace " (ipanon)
specifies the high bits of each anonymised IP address with the given IPv4
prefix. Can only be applied to IPv4 addresses and is mutually exclusive with
the 'cryptopan_key' option.

.TP
.PD 0
.BR "cryptopan_key " (ipanon)
encrypt the IP addresses using the prefix-preserving cryptopan method using
the given key.  The key can be up to 32 bytes long, and will be padded with
NULL characters.

.TP
.PD 0
.BR "encode_radius " (radius)
if set to yes, will attempt to encrypt any RADIUS traffic that is found
within the input trace.

.TP
.PD 0
.BR "ignore_safe_avps " (radius)
if set to yes, certain RADIUS AVPs that we have deemed to not be sensitive
will NOT have their values encrypted. This includes AVPs containing packet
and byte counters, service types and framed protocols.

.TP
.PD 0
.BR "salt " (radius)
sets a salt for the RADIUS encryption process. Salts longer than 32 bytes
are truncated to 32 bytes.

.TP
.PD 0
.BR "server " (radius)
tells traceanon the IP address and port numbers being used by the RADIUS
server whose traffic is to be anonymised. The expected format for this
option is 'IPaddress,accessport,accountingport'.


.SH OPTIONS
Remember that all options other than \-C are now officially deprecated.

.TP
.PD 0
.BI \-C
.TP
.BI \-\^\-config
specifies the location of the YAML configuration file.

.TP
.PD 0
.BI \-s 
.TP
.PD
.BI \-\^\-encrypt-source
encrypt only source ip addresses.

.TP
.PD 0
.BI \-d 
.TP
.PD
.BI \-\^\-encrypt-dest
encrypt only destination ip addresses.

.TP
.PD 0
.BI \-p 
.TP
.PD
.BI \-\^\-prefix=prefix
substitute the high bits of the IP addresses with the provided IPv4 prefix. 
This method will only anonymise IPv4 addresses; IPv6 packets will be untouched.

.TP
.PD 0
.BI \-c 
.TP
.PD
.BI \-\^\-cryptopan=key
encrypt the IP addresses using the prefix-preserving cryptopan method using
the key "key".  The key can be up to 32 bytes long, and will be padded with
NULL characters.


.TP
.PD 0
.BI \-F
.TP
.PD
.BI \-\^\-keyfile=file
encrypt the IP addresses using the prefix-preserving cryptopan method using
the key specified in the file "file".  The key must be 32 bytes
long. A suitable method of generating a key is by using the command dd to read
from /dev/urandom.

.TP
.PD 0
.BI \-f
.TP
.PD
.BI \-\^\-filter=expr
Discard all packets that do not match the BPF expression specified in 'expr'.
Filtering is applied *before* any anonymisation occurs, so IP address filters
will attempt to match against the original unencrypted addresses.


.TP
.PD 0
.BI \-z 
.TP
.PD
.BI \-\^\-compress-level=level
compress the output trace using a compression level of "level". Compression
level can range from 0 (no compression) through to 9. Higher compression levels
require more CPU to compress data. Defaults to no compression.

.TP
.PD 0
.BI \-Z 
.TP
.PD
.BI \-\^\-compress-type=method
compress the output trace using the compression algorithm "method". Possible
algorithms are "gz", "bz", "lzo", "xz" and "no". Default is "no".

.TP
.PD 0
.BI \-t
.TP
.PD
.BI \-\^\-threads=threadcount
use the specified number of threads to anonymise packets. The default number
of threads is 4.

.SH EXAMPLES
Given a configuration file that looks like this:

.RS
.nf
#------
  ipanon:
    encode_addresses: both
    cryptopan_key: thisisaverysecurekeyforanonpurposes

  radius:
    encode_radius: yes
    ignore_safe_avps: yes
    salt: thisisarandomlygeneratedsalt
    server: 192.168.200.1,1645,1646

  compress_level: 1
  compress_type: gzip
  threads: 1
#------
.fi
.RE

We can run traceanon using that configuration as below:

.nf
traceanon \-\^\-config=/path/to/config/file
	erf:/traces/unenc.gz \\
	erf:/traces/enc.gz \\
.fi

.SH BUGS
This software should support encrypting based on the direction/interface flag.

IP addresses inside ARP's are not encrypted.
