.SH NAME
tracemerge \- Merge one (or more) traces together
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tracemerge 
[ \-i [ interfaces_per_input ] | \-\^\-set-interface [ interfaces_per_input ] ]
[ \-u | \-\^\-unique-packets ] [ \-z | \-\^\-compress-level <level> ] 
[ \-Z | \-\^\-compress-type <method> ]

.SH DESCRPTION
tracemerge merges two or more traces together, keeping packets in order.

.TP
.PD 0
.BI \-i [ interfaces_per_input ]
.TP
.PD
.BI \-\^\-set-interface [interfaces_per_input ] 
set the interface ("direction") for each input to be unique.  The optional
inputs_per_interface parameter is how many inputs to reserve for each trace,
and defaults to 1.  Thus if you have two traces with two interfaces (in/out),
and interfaces_per_input is set to 2, then tracemerge will have the first
interface of the first input will be 0, the second interface of the first input
will be 1, the first interface of the second input will be 2, and the second
interface of the second input will be 3.

Beware that erf only supports 4 interfaces, and pcap only supports 2.
Limitations apply based on the input trace format (not the output trace format)

.TP
.PD 0
.BI \-u
.TP
.PD
.BI \-\^\-unique-packets
Ignore duplicate packets with identical timestamps.

.TP
.PD 0
.BI \-z level
.TP
.PD
.BI \-\^\-compress-level level
Sets the amount of compression performed on the output file. This value can
range from 0 (no compression) to 9 (maximum compression). Higher compression
levels require more CPU to compress data. Defaults to 0.

.TP
.PD 0
.BI \-Z method 
.TP
.PD
.BI \-\^\-compress-type method 
Describes the compression algorithm to be used when writing the output trace.
Possible methods are "gz", "bz", "lzo", "xz" and "no". Defaults to 
"no".
