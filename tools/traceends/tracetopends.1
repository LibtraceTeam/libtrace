.SH DESCRIPTION
tracetopends reports the number of bytes and packets sent and received by the
busiest endpoints observed in the input trace(s). 

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB\-t\fR threads
Use the given number of threads for packet processing. Defaults to 1 thread.

.TP
\fB\-f\fR bpf filter
Output only packets that match tcpdump style bpf filter.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR top count
Report the top N endpoints (defaults to 10).

.TP
\fB\-A\fR address type
Specifies how an endpoint should be defined. Suitable options are "mac", "v4" 
and "v6" which will report endpoint stats for each observed MAC address, IPv4
address and IPv6 address respectively.

.TP
\fB\-S
Do not track endpoints which are sending traffic. Mutually exclusive with the
\fB\-D \fRoption.

.TP
\fB\-D
Do not track endpoints which are receiving traffic. Mutually exclusive with the
\fB\-S \fRoption.

.TP
\fB\-s
Sort endpoints based on the amount of outgoing traffic (will cancel any 
previous \-d option. This is on by default.

.TP
\fB\-d
Sort endpoints based on the amount of incoming traffic (will cancel any 
previous \-s option. 

.TP
\fB\-b
Sort endpoints based on the amount of IP traffic (will cancel any previous 
\-a or \-p options. This is on by default. 

.TP
\fB\-a
Sort endpoints based on the amount of application layer traffic (will cancel 
any previous \-b or \-p options. 

.TP
\fB\-p
Sort endpoints based on the amount of packets (will cancel any previous 
\-b or \-a options. 

.SH OUTPUT
Output is written to stdout in columns separated by blank space. 

The columns are (in order):
 * Endpoint address
 * Time last observed
 * Packets originating from the endpoint
 * Bytes originating from the endpoint (IP header onwards)
 * Payload originating from the endpoint (post transport header)
 * Packets sent to the endpoint
 * Bytes sent to the endpoint (IP header onwards)
 * Payload sent to the endpoint (post transport header)

.SH EXAMPLES
Find the IPv4 addresses that are sending the most traffic.
