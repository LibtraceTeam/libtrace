.SH DESCRIPTION
traceends reports the number of bytes and packets sent and received by each
endpoint observed in the input trace(s). Usually, you don't want to run this
program directly \-\- see \fBtracetopends\fR instead.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-t\fR threads
Use the given number of threads for packet processing. Defaults to 1 thread.

.TP
\fB\-f\fR bpf filter
Ignore packets that do not match this tcpdump style bpf filter.

.TP
\fB\-A\fR address type
Specifies how an endpoint should be defined. Suitable options are "mac", "v4" 
and "v6" which will report endpoint stats for each observed MAC address, IPv4
address and IPv6 address respectively.

.TP
\fB\-S, --ignore-source\fR
Do not track endpoints which are sending traffic. Mutually exclusive with the
\fBignore-dest\fR option.

.TP
\fB\-D, --ignore-dest\fR
Do not track endpoints which are receiving traffic. Mutually exclusive with the
\fBignore-source\fR option.

.SH OUTPUT
Output is written to stdout in columns separated by blank space. 

The columns are (in order):
 * Endpoint address
 * Time last observed
 * Packets originating from the endpoint
 * Bytes originating from the endpoint (IP header onwards)
 * Payload originating from the endpoint (post transport header)
 * Packets sent to the endpoint
 * Bytes sent to the endpoint (IP header onwards)
 * Payload sent to the endpoint (post transport header)

.SH EXAMPLES
Get stats for each individual MAC address in a trace:
.nf
traceends -a mac erf:trace.erf.gz
.fi
