.SH NAME
tracereplay \- Replay a trace in trace time from one uri to another
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tracereplay

[\-f | \-\^\-filter [ filter string ] ] [\-X | \-\^\-speedup [ factor] ]

.SH DESCRPTION
tracereplay replays inputuri to outputuri in trace time. Checksums are 
recomputed on the fly.

.TP
.PD 0
.BI \-b 
.TP
.PD
.BI \-\^\-broadcast

Change the 802.3 (ethernet) destination address to the broadcast address. 
This will send the transmitted packets to any hosts on the local network.

.TP
.PD 0
.BI \-s " snaplength"
.TP
.PD
.BI \-\^\-snaplength " snaplength"
Truncate the packets to the length specified. This only makes a difference
if the inputuri is a capture device. The value should be > 0. Inappropriate 
values will be ignored, but a warning will be printed.

.TP
.PD 0
.BI \-f " filterstring"
.TP
.PD
.BI \-\^\-filter " filterstring"
Apply a filter to the inputuri.

.TP
.PD 0
.BI \-X " factor"
.TP
.PD
.BI \-\^\-speedup " factor"
Decrease the gaps between packets by the specified factor. This will accelerate
the rate at which the replay is performed. By default, the factor is 1 (i.e.
no acceleration).
