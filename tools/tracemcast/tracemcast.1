tracemcast \- multicast captured packets on an interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tracemcast
[ \-m <monitor identifier> ]
[ \-f <filterstring> ]
[ \-g <multicast group address> ]
[ \-p <port for beaconing group> ]
[ \-s <source address> ]
[ \-t <number of threads> ]
[ \-M <mtu> ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
tracemcast reads packets from a single live packet source (e.g. an interface
or hardware capture card) and then emits those packets to a multicast
group that interested clients can then join to receive an independent feed
of the captured packets.

This allows the sharing of a capture source that would normally only allow
one program to read from it at a time.

The multicasting protocol is the nDAG protocol, which libtrace supports as
an input format, so libtrace programs can natively receive packets from a
tracemcast group without any additional modifications.

.TP
\fB\-m\fR <monitor identifier>
set a unique identifier that will be included in the nDAG header. This is used
by the recipient to tell which multicast sender emitted the packet.

.TP
\fB\-f\fR <filterstring>
only emit packets that match this BPF filter expression.

.TP
\fB\-g\fR <address>
emit packets to this multicast group address (e.g. 224.0.0.1).

.TP
\fB\-p\fR <port>
send nDAG beacon messages to this port number.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR <address>
use the interface that owns this IP address to multicast packets.

.TP
\fB\-t\fR <threads>
sets the number of threads to use for capturing and multicasting packets.
Each thread will produce a separate multicast stream on a unique port.

.TP
\fB\-M\fR <bytes>
do not create any nDAG multicast messages larger than this number of bytes.
Don't forget to allow for additional encapsulation (e.g. Ethernet, IP, UDP)
when determining this value.
