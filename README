This directory contains source code for libtrace, a userspace library for 
processing of network traffic capture from live interfaces or from offline
traces.

libtrace was primarily designed for use with the real-time interface to the 
Waikato DAG Capture Point software running at The University of Waikato, 
and has been since extended to a range of other trace and interface formats.
