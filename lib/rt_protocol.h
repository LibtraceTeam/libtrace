/* Procedure for adding new RT control types
 * -------------------------------------------
 *
 * Add type to the enum list
 * Add a struct below (even if it is empty - wrap it in an #if 0)
 * Update rt_get_capture_length
 * If type is intended to be sent TO clients, update rt_read_packet
 * 	Otherwise, update server implementations e.g. WDCAP
 *
 * Procedure for adding new RT data types
 * ----------------------------------------
 * 
 * If you are adding a new format:
 * 	RT_DATA_(new format) must be equal to RT_DATA_SIMPLE + 
 * 		TRACE_FORMAT_(new_format)
 * 	Add a new dummy trace type to the rt_format_t structure
 * 	Set the dummy trace to NULL in rt_init_input
 * 	Update rt_set_format
 *
 * If you are adding a new PCAP DLT type:
 * 	RT_DATA_PCAP_(new DLT) must be equal to RT_DATA_PCAP + (DLT value)
 *
